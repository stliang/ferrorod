      Layout is a group of Material-UI components that are enhanced and combined
      to create dynamic, easy-to-maintain and easy-to-code as much as possible.

    <Typography gutterBottom>
      I created this because
      <br />
    </Typography>
    <Typography component={"div"}>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It took me a lot of time to initialize dashboard layout when I have
          new projects and I’m sure that a lot of you guys agree with me.

        <li>
          Sometimes it is hard to refactor because the structure is so poor
          because someone isn’t deeply understand what he/she was doing, as a
          result, rewrite the whole layout (it actually happened, at least in my
          experience).
        </li>
        <li>
          Because we need to be fast to let others continue our work, we
          frequently write poor and a lot of code. However, we say we don’t have
          time to fix them. Eventually, spend all day paying technical debts.

      Objectives
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      It must be easy enough to use, however still be able to adjust to compat
      with real word examples and usages. More importantly, it need to follow{" "}
      <Link
        target={"_blank"}
        rel="noopener"
        href={"https://material.io/design/components/navigation-drawer.html#"}
        underline={"none"}
      >
        Material specs
      </Link>{" "}
      since we are 100% based on Material-UI with no other styling libraries.
      Last but not least, responsive is a must.

      Solution
    </Typography>
    <Typography>Separate layout into 5 components</Typography>
    <Typography component={"div"}>
      <ul>
        <li>Root</li>
        <li>Header (AppBar)</li>
        <li>Nav (Drawer)</li>
        <li>Content</li>
        <li>Footer</li>
      </ul>
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      <b>Root</b> will provide context to other components to sync states across
      them.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      <b>Behavior</b> of your layout will be controlled by using config (just a
      plain object) that will be injected to the Root.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      <b>Presets</b> is a set of predefined config that I can come up with after
      researching a lot of the real world websites and also the{" "}
