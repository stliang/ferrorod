# Ferro Rod

Ferro Rod is a Firebase starter kit based on React and Bulma

## Related projects

This starter kit consists of three projects:

1.) ferrorod is the front-end

2.) ferrofunctions is the back-end functions

3.) ferroadmin is admin utilities


## Features

The aim of this project is to provide role based google authentication, CSS, React hooks, React context, React Table, and data visulization.

## Setup

In order to run this starter kit, you must create a project and database in Firebase.  Go to Project settings and add a web app.  Transfer your Firebase SDK snippet to your local .env.development file.

## TODO

1.) Theme up react table, right now the cells are too wide and the boarder sytle don't fit within the overal theme of the project.

2.) Restructure the Assets page code. The style.component seems to belong to a different location.  The editable cell code block seems to be reusable somewhere else.
